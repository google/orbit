    \title The Object Controller Example.

    \image object_controller.png

    This example implements a simple widget component which shows
    QObject's and its subclasses' properties. The user can modify these properies interacively
    and the object controller applies the changes to the controlled object.
    The object controller is similar to the property editor used in QDesigner application.
    To control the object just instantiate ObjectController, set controlled object (any QObject subclass) by
    calling ObjectController::setObject() and show the controller.

    The source files can be found in examples/object_controller directory of the package.
