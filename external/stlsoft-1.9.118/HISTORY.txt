 A few changes and updates to various components, primarily to support the

 coming ... honest.


30th April 2007 - 1.9.1 released (for Extended STL, volume 1: CD)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 There has been an enormous amount of change in STLSoft from the last
 release, 1.8.9 (October 2005), to the new release, 1.9.1 (April/May 2007).

 Consequently, I just can't muster the effort at this time to detail the
 entire set of changes. The one big change I will note, however, is that
 the library files no longer reside in the root directory, e.g.

   comstl_bstr_functions.h

 and are now in appropriate sub-directories under the sub-project
 sub-directories, e.g.

   comstl/string/bstr_functions.h
